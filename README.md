# HTTP

# Protocol 

We are communicating. using the protocols . let think it like this way , suppose I have write a letter to you , Its like (Raise you hand) and I send it to you . You some how understand this and than you raise your hand . this is the thing, this protocol we both agreed to do  is we communicate through the protocol.. This is the rule we both agreed upon . 


In computer to computer communication there is a rule and two computer agreed to stay on that rule and use it. the protocol is HTTP . 

Suppose a computer send 01001100 to another computer and the HTTP will tell the another computer how to perse it and get the value. 


When two computers communicate with each other, they need to use the same rules. An English speaker can't communicate verbally with a Japanese speaker, similarly, two computers need to speak the same language to communicate.

This "language" that computers use is called a protocol. The most popular protocol for web communication is HTTP, which stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol.


# How HTTP actually work : 

At the heart of HTTP is a simple request-response system. The "requesting" computer, also known as the "client", asks another computer for some information. That computer, "the server" sends back a response with the information that was requested.

# life cycle of HTTP : 

Its very simple , The client or computer ask for a response / data to server (another computer) and the server returns the data if it has it.

# URL (Uniform Resource Locator)

A URL, or Uniform Resource Locator, is essentially the address of another computer, or "server" on the internet. Part of the URL specifies how to reach the server, and part of it tells the server what information we want - but more on that later.

For now, it's important to understand that a URL represents a piece of information on another computer that we want access to. We can get access to it by making a request, and reading the response that the server replies with.
